# Neuro ML minigrid

Welcome!

This project is underway to uncover correlates between human brains and RL agents!  


We plan on doing this via having people play a gridworld game while connected to an fMRI machine.   

Fork from the fine work at https://github.com/maximecb/gym-minigrid

## Getting started
Load the gym environment and dependencies with
```
cd minigrid
pip3 install -e .
```
(this should cover additional custom environments.

Then run 

```
./launch.sh
```

Thanks for visiting this project!
