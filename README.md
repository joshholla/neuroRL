# Neuro RL correlates

Welcome!

This project aspires to uncover correlates between human brains and RL agents!  

We plan on doing this via having people play a gridworld game while connected to an fMRI machine.   
The gridworld is built upon the fine work at https://github.com/maximecb/gym-minigrid

## Getting started
Load the gym environment and dependencies with
```
TODO
cd minigrid
pip3 install -e .
```
(this should install the additional custom environments required for running our tests)


If you would like to play the game, make sure you are in xyz folder. Then run 

```
./launch.sh
```
The following flags are optional:
```
./todo
```


For logging to comet.ml, please ensure that you have a settings.json file in the following format:

To run the RL scripts, please run the following commands:
For DQN:
```
./todo
```

Thanks for visiting this project!

## TODO
+ Instructions for how to use the environment / Command line instrucitons
+ Add the settings.json file? or instructions for what to add.
