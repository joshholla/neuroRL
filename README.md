# Neuro RL correlates

Welcome!

This project aspires to uncover correlates between human brains and RL agents!  
We invite people play our gridworld game while an fMRI machine measures brain activity.  

The gridworld environment is built upon the fine work at https://github.com/maximecb/gym-minigrid

## Getting started
First ensure that you have installed python3 on your system.   

Begin by cloning this project. 
```
git clone https://github.com/joshholla/neuroRL.git 
```

The folder locally structure should look like this

```
.
`-- neuroRL
    |-- README.md
    |-- neuroRL
    |   |-- __init__.py
    |   |-- enhanced_neuro_view.py
    |   |-- envs
    |   |   |-- __init__.py
    |   |   `-- empty.py
    |   |-- rlscripts
    |   |   |-- DQN.py
    |   |   |-- main.py
    |   |   |-- utils.py
    |   |   `-- visualize_Pending.py
    |   |-- runrl.sh
    |   `-- utils.py
    `-- setup.py
```
To set up a virtual environment, run the following commands

```
cd neuroRL
conda create --name neuroRLenv python=3.6
conda activate neuroRLenv

```

Install the gym environment and other dependencies by navigating to this folder and running:
```
pip3 install -e .
```
(this will install the additional custom environments required for running our tests)  

If you would like to play the game, first ensure that you activate the virtual environment we created 
```
conda activate neuroRLenv
```
Assuming you are in the folder where this README resides, run 

```
cd neuroRL
python enhanced_neuro_view.py
```

To control the agent in the gridworld, use the following buttons on your keyboard:

- "1" to pivot left.
- "2" to move the agent forward.
- "3" to pivot right.
We wanted to account for bias in directional arrow keys and so we've chosen these buttons for this version.  
Future versions plan on connecting to a game controller for movement and interaction.  

The following flags add functionality to your experiments: 
```
--comet [Flag to toggle logging data to cometml]  
--namestr [Flag for the remote name of the experiment (in cometml)]  
--random_inputs [Including these inputs will randomize the inputs on the keyboard]  
--expert_view [This will let the user see the entire map including what the agent normally has vision of]  
```

For logging to comet.ml, please ensure that you have a settings.json file in the `/rlscripts` folder in the following format:
```
{
  "api_key": "<Insert Key from comet here>",
  "project_name": "<Where you'd like to log your results>",
  "workspace": "<usually your comet username>"
}
```

To run an RL agent on this environment, you can run the following commands:
```
./runrl.sh
```

Thanks for visiting this project!
